Pre-processing: The raw file was exceeded Github’s size limits, so I filtered the full dataset with the following:
`df.loc[(df['City'] == 'CHICAGO') & (df['Business'] == ‘Y’)]`
Most licenses are for individuals. Filtering for businesses only took the total number of records for Chicago license holders from ~775K to ~32K.
